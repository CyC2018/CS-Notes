<h2>Known failures</h2>
<p>There are certain edge cases where Prism will fail.
    There are always such cases in every regex-based syntax highlighter.
    However, Prism dares to be open and honest about them.
    If a failure is listed here, it doesn’t mean it will never be fixed. This is more of a “known bugs” list, just with a certain type of bug.
