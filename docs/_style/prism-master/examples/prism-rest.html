<pre><code>:Date: 2001-08-16
:Version: 1
:Authors: - Me
          - Myself
          - I
:Indentation: Since the field marker may be quite long, the second
   and subsequent lines of the field body do not have to line up
   with the first line, but they must be indented relative to the
   field name marker, and they must line up with each other.
:Parameter i: integer</code></pre>

<h2>Option lists</h2>
<pre><code>-a         Output all.
-b         Output both (this description is
           quite long).

--long     Output all day long.

-p         This option has two paragraphs in the description.
           This is the first.

           options (as above) or left in (as here and below).

                    the required two spaces.

--an-even-longer-option
           The description can also start on the next line.

<h2>Literal blocks</h2>
<pre><code>::

    for a in [5,4,3,2,1]:   # this is program code, shown as-is
        print a
    print "it's..."
    # a literal block continues until the indentation ends

<h2>Footnotes and links</h2>
<pre><code>.. [1] Body elements go here.

If [#note]_ is the first footnote reference, it will show up as
"[1]".  We can refer to it again as [#note]_ and again see
"[1]".  We can also refer to it as note_ (an ordinary internal
hyperlink reference).

.. [#note] This is the footnote labeled "note".

Here is a symbolic footnote reference: [*]_.

.. [*] This is the footnote.

[2]_ will be "2" (manually numbered),
[#]_ will be "3" (anonymous auto-numbered), and
[#label]_ will be "1" (labeled auto-numbered).

.. [2] This footnote is labeled manually, so its number is fixed.

.. [#label] This autonumber-labeled footnote will be labeled "1".
   It is the first auto-numbered footnote and no other footnote
   with label "1" exists.  The order of the footnotes is used to
   determine numbering, not the order of the footnote references.

.. [#] This footnote will be labeled "3".  It is the second
   auto-numbered footnote, but footnote label "2" is already used.

Here is a citation reference: [CIT2002]_.

.. [CIT2002] This is the citation.  It's just like a footnote,
   except the label is textual.

.. _hyperlink-name: link-block

.. __: anonymous-hyperlink-target-link-block

__ anonymous-hyperlink-target-link-block

Clicking on this internal hyperlink will take us to the target_
below.

.. _target:

The hyperlink target above points to this paragraph.</code></pre>

<h2>Directives</h2>
<pre><code>.. image:: mylogo.jpeg

   The larch.

.. note:: This is a paragraph

   - Here is a bullet list.

.. figure:: picture.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: map to buried treasure

   This is the caption of the figure (a simple paragraph).

   The legend consists of all elements after the caption.  In this
   case, the legend consists of this paragraph and the following
   table:

   +-----------------------+-----------------------+
   | Symbol                | Meaning               |

<h2>Inline markup</h2>
<pre><code>This is *emphasized text*.
This is **strong text**.
This is `interpreted text`.
:role:`interpreted text`
`interpreted text`:role:
This text is an example of ``inline literals``.
The regular expression ``[+-]?(\d+(\.\d*)?|\.\d+)`` matches
floating-point numbers (without exponents).

Oh yes, the _`Norwegian Blue`.  What's, um, what's wrong with it?</code></pre>

<h2>Known failures</h2>
<p>There are certain edge cases where Prism will fail.
	There are always such cases in every regex-based syntax highlighter.
	However, Prism dares to be open and honest about them.
	If a failure is listed here, it doesn’t mean it will never be fixed. This is more of a “known bugs” list, just with a certain type of bug.
