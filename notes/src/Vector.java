/**
 * The {@code Vector} class implements a growable array of
 * objects. Like an array, it contains components that can be
 * accessed using an integer index. However, the size of a
 * {@code Vector} can grow or shrink as needed to accommodate
 * adding and removing items after the {@code Vector} has been created.
 *
 * <p>Each vector tries to optimize storage management by maintaining a
 * {@code capacity} and a {@code capacityIncrement}. The
 * {@code capacity} is always at least as large as the vector
 * size; it is usually larger because as components are added to the
 * vector, the vector's storage increases in chunks the size of
 * {@code capacityIncrement}. An application can increase the
 * capacity of a vector before inserting a large number of
 * components; this reduces the amount of incremental reallocation.
 *
 * <p><a name="fail-fast"/>
 * The iterators returned by this class's {@link #iterator() iterator} and
 * {@link #listIterator(int) listIterator} methods are <em>fail-fast</em>:
 * if the vector is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is
 * created, in any way except through the iterator's own
 * {@link ListIterator#remove() remove} or
 * {@link ListIterator#add(Object) add} methods, the iterator will throw a
 * {@link ConcurrentModificationException}.  Thus, in the face of
 * concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather
 * than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined
 * time in the future.  The {@link Enumeration Enumerations} returned by
 * the {@link #elements() elements} method are <em>not</em> fail-fast.
 *
 * <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
 * as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
 * presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
 * throw {@code ConcurrentModificationException} on a best-effort basis.
 * Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
 * exception for its correctness:  <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators
 * should be used only to detect bugs.</i>
 *
 * <p>As of the Java 2 platform v1.2, this class was retrofitted to
 * implement the {@link List} interface, making it a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.  Unlike the new collection
 * implementations, {@code Vector} is synchronized.  If a thread-safe
 * implementation is not needed, it is recommended to use {@link
 * ArrayList} in place of {@code Vector}.
