## Postscript :memo:

(a) About the warehouse

This warehouse is the author's learning summary during the preparation of the 2018 spring recruitment practice. The content is mainly based on the study notes of computer books. It will try to ensure systematic knowledge while arranging key knowledge.

(b) About uploading

The author uses local knowledge-writing software for writing. In order to facilitate the uploading of local notes to Github, a set of automated uploading schemes are implemented, including the export of text files, extraction of images, Markdown document conversion, and Git synchronization.

The reason for doing Markdown document conversion is that the GFM used by Github does not support MathJax formulas, nor does it support TOC tagging. Therefore, you need to replace the MathJax formula with CodeCogs cloud service and regenerate the TOC directory. Here is the download of the GFM document conversion tool that I have implemented: [GFM-Converter] (https://github.com/CyC2018/GFM-Converter).

(III) About Typesetting

The contents of the notes are in accordance with [Chinese Copywriting Guidelines North] (http://mazhuang.org/wiki/chinese-copywriting-guidelines/#%E4%B8%8D%E8%A6%81%E4%BD%BF%E7%94 %A8%E4%B8%8D%E5%9C%B0%E9%81%93%E7%9A%84%E7%BC%A9%E5%86%99) typesetting to ensure the readability of the content. Here provides the author to achieve the download of Chinese and English document layout tools: [Text-Typesetting] (https://github.com/CyC2018/Markdown-Typesetting), the current implementation of the function of adding spaces, only to the command line Way to run. After that, it intends to implement the function of prompting the first letter of English proper nouns and to make a user interface.

The reason for not using the `![]()` method to reference a picture is to be able to control the picture to be displayed at the proper size, and you cannot use `<center> ![]() </center>` to make a picture in GFM. Centered, this can only be achieved using `<div align="center"> <img src=""/> </div>`.

(d) About Error Correction

Most of the content is written in one word or another. It is inevitable that there will be some clerical errors. If found, edits can be edited directly on the corresponding document.

If you find errors, I hope you can correct them. Thank you!

You can also post feedback in Issues.

(e) Reprinted

The materials used in this warehouse content will be quoted in the last reference. I hope you can also use the contents of this warehouse to give the corresponding reference link. After all, writing for a long time is not so easy.
